Sometimes strategic or military deception is necessary. Huma Abedin attended an event in NYC on Oct. 25, walked with her family in NYC on Oct 27, attended HRC's 70th birthday part and seen with her son on Nov. 6 and 7th. This may have something to do with Russia as events progress, due to North Korea and Iran. POTUS surrounds himself with generals to ensure the safety of the executive and prevent any attempts at a coup because the generals he picked are loyal and experts at strategy. Marines in particular are deployable at POTUS' discretion without Congressional approval. Military Intelligence (MI) is a discipline that uses information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to commanders in support of their decisions. The reason to do around the 3-letter agencies (CIA, FBI et al) is that they have been infiltrated by bad actors who aren't acting in the best interests of the US. Those agencies also have civilian staff, more secrecy and politically-motivated missions, which lead to too much leaking and input from politicians. POTUS has the ultimate authority over our branches of military without approval conditions unless over 90 days in wartime conditions, due to the War Powers Act. The military code is a system of conventional symbols for the covert transmission of secret military information through communications equipment. Anthony Weiner, husband of Huma Abedin is in Federal Medical Center, Devens, a federal prison in Massachusetts., minimum security for male sex offenders. POTUS will go on tv to address the nation to discuss ongoing investigations into corruption and other crimes in Washington D.C.. Doing so would invite criticism and a media storm upon which there would be focus, capitalized on and distorted, which would be inappropriate and damaging to the POTUS and the office. POTUS knew the first step was to remove rogue criminal elements let Lady Justice prove nobody is above the law. POTUS exercised his authority granted to him through irresponsible allocations of power to the Executive Office. Everything POTUS is doing is legal because the swamp made it legal for it's own nefarious purposes. Besides the NSA, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is the only person who knows everything.  If Sessions is the prosecutor then he knows everything because he's the one building the case. He has access to  evidence collected by parties like Admiral Rogers and General Kelly and probably more. General Kelly probably isn't aware of the intelligence Admiral Rogers has dropped on Sessions in it's entirety, just as Admiral Rogers isn't privy to all the information General Kelly has offered. For a case like this, everything is compartmentalized. Even the President probably only knows exactly what he needs to know to run his office effectively. The man at the top would be the only person who knew the entire lay of the land, that man is Jeff Sessions. It is a fantasy to believe that HRC, Soros, Obama et al have more power than POTUS. Whoever controls the office of the Presidecy controls this great land. They never thought they would lose the Executive Office, and when they did it was an immediate declaration of war between the Patriotic Factions of the US Government and the Swamp. This is not a Republican versus Democrat battle. The partisan bickering you see publicly is a dog and pony show and dramatics for public consumption. George Soros donated $18 billion to the Open Society because extra slush funds were needed to accomplish the agenda.

Since the new regulations came fairly quickly, the goals were set in short and long terms. According to Jim Abrams, some of the short term goals included \"criminal background checks on 750,000 airport employees, the presence of more law enforcement, the screening of all checked baggage with whatever means available, including X-ray machines and hand inspections, the placement of more air marshals on flights, and more passengers will be pre-screened, with more cross-checking with FBI and other watch lists for suspicious passengers\" (2001). As of 2003, the department of Homeland Security, headed by Tom Ridge, made the decision to increase the number of air marshals by 5,000 (Regional, 2003). Those short-term affects were to happen within the first year of implementation. The long term affects of the new security on airlines were: \"A new Transportation Department agency put in place to oversee all transportation security measures, all 28,000 airport baggage screeners [are] federal workers, all checked baggage is to be inspected with explosives detection machines, [and] Trusted-passenger programs will be implemented, using new technologies to identify passengers and expedite screening\" (Abrams, 2001). Most of the new regulations proposed security of the baggage and the passengers on the plane. According to the TSA, as quoted in the article by Gerald L. Dillingham, \"[The TSA has] confiscated more than 4.8 million prohibited items (including firearms, knives, and incendiary or flammable objects) from passengers\" (2003, p. 8). The Department of Homeland Security has also backed up this fact by stating \"airport screeners have, since February 2002, intercepted more than 7.8 million items, including 1,437 firearms, 2.3 million knives, and 49,331 box cutters - the terrorists' weapon of choice on 9-11. Attempts at concealment included razor blades hidden in tennis shoes\" (Gips, 2003). http://www.ifpo.org/resource-links/articles-and-reports/protection-of-specific-environments/the-evolution-of-airline-security-since-911/","confidence":""},{"line":"What local airports are in close proximity to DC?","answer":"- BWI (Baltimore INT); \n- IAD (Dulles INT); \n- DCA (Reagan INT); \n- JYO (Leesburg Regional);\n- Manassas Regional /Harry P Davis Field - Manassas, VA   -Montgomery County Airpark (GAI)\n- Note that the following 3 General Aviation/Regional airports \"Maryland 3\" are subject to Washington, D.C. \"Area Special Flight Rules: VKX (Potomac); CGS (College Park); W32 (Washington Executive).\nSee: http://www.flying20club.org/documents/DC_SFRA_Presentation.pdf","extraAnswer":"","confidence":"high"},{"line":"What happened shortly after 9-11 (specifically with all aircraft)?","answer":"Mandatory forced grounding of all air crafts.\n-NOTAM (Notice to All Airmen) issued by FAA at 10:57am on 09/11/01.","extraAnswer":"FAA Rapid Response Team on Aircraft Security created, recommends the hardening of existing cockpit doors and expediting the design, production and installation of new doors.","confidence":"high"},{"line":"Who was authorized to depart?

Part of that came in 2014, although the database doesn’t specify how much. The Australian government has given between $5 million and $10 million, at least part of which came in 2014. It also gave in 2013, when its donations fell in the same range. Qatar’s government committee preparing for the 2022 soccer World Cup gave between $250,000 and $500,000 in 2014. Qatar’s government had previously donated between $1 million and $5 million. Oman, which had made a donation previously, gave an undisclosed amount in 2014.
