Follow Huma.\n\nHuma has attended several public events and been seen with her family in NYC.\n\n### This has nothing to do w/ Russia (yet).\n\nThis may have something to do with Russia as events progress, due to NK and Iran.\n\n### Why does Potus surround himself w/ generals?\n\n- To prevent a coup and ensure the safety of executive.\n- The Generals he picked are loyal to the country and well respected in the military.\n- They are experts in strategy.\n\n### What is military intelligence?\n\nA military discipline that uses information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to commanders in support of their decisions.\n\n### Why go around the 3 letter agencies?\n\nBecause the 3-letters agencies have been infiltrated by bad actors who are not acting in the interest of the US\n\n### Who has ultimate authority over our branches of military w\\o approval conditions unless 90+ in wartime conditions?\n\nPOTUS\n\n### What is the military code?\n\nMilitary code is a system of conventional symbols for the covert transmission of secret military information through communications equipment.\n\nThe conventional symbols are made up by the staff headquarters and may be numbers, letters, and so forth. The simplest military codes are conversation and radio-signal tables made up for a definite span of time or the duration of a combat operation. There are combined-arms and special military codes (for one combat arm or one service of the armed forces, such as an aviation or navy code)\n\n### Where is AW being held? Why?\n\n(Anthony Weiner, husband of Huma Abedin)\nAnthony Wiener is in the Federal jail.\n\n### POTUS will not go on tv to address nation.\n\nPOTUS will not discuss ongoing investigations into the Swamp.\n\n### POTUS must isolate himself to prevent negative optics.\n\nIf POTUS did so, it would invite criticism and a media storm upon which there would be focus, capitalized on and distorted, which would be inappropriate and damaging to the POTUS and the office.\n\n### POTUS knew removing criminal rogue elements as a first step was essential to free and pass legislation.\n\nPOTUS is going to let Lady Justice prove nobody is above the law. POTUS exercised his authority granted to him through irresponsible allocations of power to the Executive Office. Everything POTUS is doing is legal because the swamp made it legal for it's own nefarious purposes.\n\n### Who has access to everything classified?\n\nJeff Sessions (Attorney General) is the only person who knows everything. Literally everything.\n\nHe knows where the bodies are buried.\nHe knows the bank information.\nHe knows everything.\nHe probably knows things the President doesn't know for the sake of OPSec.\nA President interested in the pursuit of justice instead of obstructing it to cover their masters asses means actual tangible enforcement of Justice.\n\n### Do you believe HRC, Soros, Obama etc have more power than Trump?

His Open Society Foundation disseminates the slush fund to other parties for operations.\n\n### Why would he place all his funds in a RC?\n\nLess investigations happen into (registered) charities because all monies are donated and go towards “good causes” so long as the charity isn’t being used to make a profit. Open Society Foundation offers grants to individuals and organisations, however the majority are organisations. You don’t have to apply for a grant like most charities, OSF will actually approach you if they deem your organisation suitable for “investment”\n\n### Mockingbird\n\nOperation Mockingbird- the CIA placed a bunch of assets into media organizations to control the narrative. This was done AFTER it was made illegal for the government to subject the American people to propaganda, but they got away with it anyway.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nPOTUS will not go on TV to address nation. POTUS must isolate himself to prevent negative optics. POTUS knew that removing criminal rogue elements was a first step and essential to freedom to pass legislation. Someone has access to everything classified. Hillary, Soros, Obama etc don't have more power than Trump. Whoever controls the office of the Presidecy controls this great land. Democrats and Republicans never believed for a moment they would lose control. This is not a RvD battle. Soros donated all his money recently. He placed all his funds in a RC.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### Mockingbird\n\n### HRC detained, not arrested (yet).\n\nMilitary or strategic deception is sometimes necessary.

Hillary may or may not have been detained (but not arrested yet). Sometimes strategic or military deception is necessary. Huma Abedin attended an event in NYC on Oct. 25, walked with her family in NYC on Oct 27, attended HRC's 70th birthday part and seen with her son on Nov. 6 and 7th. This may have something to do with Russia as events progress, due to North Korea and Iran. POTUS surrounds himself with generals to ensure the safety of the executive and prevent any attempts at a coup because the generals he picked are loyal and experts at strategy. Marines in particular are deployable at POTUS' discretion without Congressional approval. Military Intelligence (MI) is a discipline that uses information collection and analysis approaches to provide guidance and direction to commanders in support of their decisions. The reason to do around the 3-letter agencies (CIA, FBI et al) is that they have been infiltrated by bad actors who aren't acting in the best interests of the US. Those agencies also have civilian staff, more secrecy and politically-motivated missions, which lead to too much leaking and input from politicians. POTUS has the ultimate authority over our branches of military without approval conditions unless over 90 days in wartime conditions, due to the War Powers Act. The military code is a system of conventional symbols for the covert transmission of secret military information through communications equipment. Anthony Weiner, husband of Huma Abedin is in Federal Medical Center, Devens, a federal prison in Massachusetts., minimum security for male sex offenders. POTUS will go on tv to address the nation to discuss ongoing investigations into corruption and other crimes in Washington D.C.. Doing so would invite criticism and a media storm upon which there would be focus, capitalized on and distorted, which would be inappropriate and damaging to the POTUS and the office. POTUS knew the first step was to remove rogue criminal elements let Lady Justice prove nobody is above the law. POTUS exercised his authority granted to him through irresponsible allocations of power to the Executive Office. Everything POTUS is doing is legal because the swamp made it legal for it's own nefarious purposes. Besides the NSA, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is the only person who knows everything.  If Sessions is the prosecutor then he knows everything because he's the one building the case. He has access to  evidence collected by parties like Admiral Rogers and General Kelly and probably more. General Kelly probably isn't aware of the intelligence Admiral Rogers has dropped on Sessions in it's entirety, just as Admiral Rogers isn't privy to all the information General Kelly has offered. For a case like this, everything is compartmentalized. Even the President probably only knows exactly what he needs to know to run his office effectively. The man at the top would be the only person who knew the entire lay of the land, that man is Jeff Sessions. It is a fantasy to believe that HRC, Soros, Obama et al have more power than POTUS. Whoever controls the office of the Presidecy controls this great land. They never thought they would lose the Executive Office, and when they did it was an immediate declaration of war between the Patriotic Factions of the US Government and the Swamp. This is not a Republican versus Democrat battle. The partisan bickering you see publicly is a dog and pony show and dramatics for public consumption. George Soros donated $18 billion to the Open Society because extra slush funds were needed to accomplish the agenda. His Open Society Foundation disseminates the slush fund to other parties for operations. Less investigations happen into (registered) charities because all monies are donated and go towards “good causes” so long as the charity isn’t being used to make a profit. Open Society Foundation offers grants to individuals and organisations,\n\n","147104628":"## answers\n\n### Open your eyes.\n\nPay attention, look at things with a different point of view not the one you are used to.

They also function as sleeper cells to be activated at a later date to unleash chaos, disorder and mayhem on the public. This must be stopped and cleaned out immediately.\n\n### Could people pay such gangs to kill opponents and why / how to insulate against exposure?\n\nUsing gangs as assassins has historical precedent and provides the person ordering the initial \"hit\" layers of plausible deniability by going through several intermediaries in the underworld (separate social spheres). No one would expect, hypothetically, for Nancy Pelosi to ask an MS-13 member to kill someone.\n\n### The truth is mind blowing and cannot fully be exposed. These people are evil.\n\nThe extent of corruption is pervasive but still within the reach of the common person to grasp. But the level of degeneracy and occult acts, and the widespread nature of that, is so shocking and foreign that most people will not be able to accept the truth that many members of our government engage in this activity. It is simply too shocking and horrifying, and yet it is true.\n\n### Operation Mockingbird\n\nMockingbird media is how the public is not aware of the answers to the questions Q just posed. The connections are purposely avoided in the Mockingbird media to cover for the cabal and the network of bad actors' deeds.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n## extra answers\n\n### Some of us come here to drop crumbs, just crumbs.\n\n### POTUS is 100% insulated - any discussion suggesting he’s even a target is false.\n\n-He has his own network instead of the government provided network. That's why he wanted his own plane refitted instead of using AF1\n\n### Follow Huma tomorrow.\n\n### POTUS will not be addressing nation on any of these issues as people begin to be indicted and must remain neutral for pure optical reasons. To suggest this is the plan is false and should be common sense.\n\nAny notifications of arrests of politicos would be done by the Justice Department. Remember how the US government works and the purview of different agencies and departments.\n\n### Focus on Military Intelligence/ State Secrets and why might that be used vs any three letter agency\n\nThis is due to several reasons: \n1) the likelihood the act shall result in loss-of-life and/or harm to US servicemembers and/or US Gov property (installations, ships, aircraft), \n2) the act could compromise Def Dept regs mandating the conducting of no more than six operational theaters of war at any given time, \n3) the information's source indicates a clear violation of security clearance protocols, and thus violates National Security.\n\nIn case 3, Homeland Sec Act, and Patriot Act, and Military Commissions Act(s) mandate the violator(s) loss of Constitutional Rights, and confirms the violator as an enemy agent provacateur, now subject to the UCMJ.

Primary glioblastoma is most often found in the back of the brain and treatment consists of  surgery with aggressive battery of radiation and chemotherapy. Survivial rates are low, only 39% of adults live one year post diagnosis.\n\nCNN: http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/19/health/gupta-mccain-glioblastoma/index.html\n\nWebMD: https://www.webmd.com/cancer/brain-cancer/what-is-glioblastoma#1\n\n### Why did Soros transfer his bulk public funds to a NP? Note this doesn’t include massive slush funds that are pulled by several high ups.\n\nTo continue plans that those organizations have to been tasked to do.e.g. Antifa  Fund diversions. Because Open Society has operatives in nearly every country, this allows him to still have power with money globally.\n\n### Why did Soros’ son have several meetings with Canadian PM and how is that related to Clinton’s?\n\n- Because Clinton's received money for Uranium One through the foundation in Canada, could this be an attempt to receive assistance in covering evidence?\n- Fusion GPS is located in Canada. Possibly to threaten the implications of Canada conspiring with them to/pay off to keep quiet.\n\n### Why is MS13 a priority?\n\nMs-13 acting as assassins, and secret army follows CIA and FBI history for contracting dirty work. Their handbook says, \"never do your own killing.\"\n\n### Could people pay such gangs to kill opponents and why / how to insulate against exposure?\n\n### The truth is mind blowing and cannot fully be exposed. These people are evil.\n\nSomething that must be considered is civil unrest. A distraught populace could react in violent and unpredictable ways.  People could fall into despair or become dangerous with a mob mentality and do something that would not heal our country but divide it further.\n\n### Operation Mockingbird\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n","147167304":"## answers\n\n### Why wasn’t HRC prosecuted for the emails?

Democrats have historically committed voter fraud with this population group by bussing people around to vote multiple times at different polling locations, having felons vote (illegal except in VA), dead persons voting in order to swing elections in their favor. Without this voting bloc, Democrats would lose seats in local, state and federal elections.\n\n### At some point the great awakening will occur whereby these false local / national black leaders are corrupt and paid off to help keep the black pop poor and in need.\n\nUnless something really radical, hard evidence comes out, Blacks will be in denial.

As long as the Black population believes this, the Democrats maintain control of this important voting bloc though they make up only 12% of the population.\n\n### At some point the great awakening will occur whereby these false local / national black leaders are corrupt and paid off to help keep the black pop poor and in need.\n\n### D’s formed the confederate states against freeing slaves.\n\nFederal government wanted slaves to be counted as property to be taxed to fill the coffers. It should also be noted that Pres. Lincoln freed ONLY the slaves in the South, not the North. The was was never about slavery.\n\n### D’s formed the KKK.\n\nThe best way to shift the Overton Window is through a serious, fear based event where the \"victim\" is so terrorized that they will gladly sacrifice their liberty for promised safety.

MI is not as corrupted and infested with globalist assets \n2. MI is under the direction of POTUS ONLY, not other agencies. \n3. MI OPS (operations) and products are protected from other corrupt agencies using STATE SECRETS powers, which the globalists gave to POTUS over the last 30 years. Now its turned on them.\n\n### No approval or congressional oversight\n\n### State Secrets upheld under SC\n\nAn evidentiary rule created by U.S. legal precedent. Application of the privilege results in exclusion of evidence from a legal case based solely on affidavits submitted by the government stating that court proceedings might disclose sensitive information which might endanger national security. U.S. v. Reynolds, which involved military secrets, was the first case that saw formal recognition of the privilege. Following a claim of \"state secrets privilege\", the court rarely conducts an in camera examination of the evidence to evaluate whether there is sufficient cause to support the use of this doctrine. This results in court rulings in which even the judge has not verified the veracity of the assertion. The privileged material is completely removed from the litigation, and the court must determine how the unavailability of the privileged information affects the case.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege\n\n### Who is the Commander and Chief of the military?\n\n### Under what article can the President impose MI take over investigations for the 3 letter agencies?

These were checks and balances to the usurption and abuse of US internal policy which, as in the case of some Sept 11 Attackers whose visas were not thoroughly vetted, where these bureacratic practices could amount to \"holes\" in the US statuatory armor. Also, the Pat Act gives Potus the authority to declare any group hostile to US \"terrorists\". \n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.crf-usa.org/america-responds-to-terrorism/the-patriot-act.html&ved=0ahUKEwi5lZrC57vXAhUm6oMKHQ_9DtUQFggsMAE&usg=AOvVaw3ZZbNiz5OhLr-k9nNy8Yt3 \n\nAt that point, under PATRIOT Act detention is legal, and under the Military Commissions Act of 2008, the tribunals are now engageable.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nMI does not answer to Congress, has the most access to mined data and classified information.

Military tribunals.

Michele Bachman tried to in 2012 but it didn't work because she claimed Huma was MB. Huma was defended by Pelosi, Ellison, and McCain.\n\n### What happens if Soros funded operations get violent and engage in domestic terrorism?\n\n-They can classified as domestic terrorist group\n-He can be declared an enemy of the State. \n-Americans involved with Soros can be charged with crimes up to sedition and terrorism.\n-Marital Law would be declared\n\n10 U.S.C. §§ 331-335 (President may use the militia and Armed Forces to suppress insurrection and enforce federal\n\n### What happens if mayors/ police comms/chiefs do not enforce the law?\n\nSend in the National Guard\n\n### What authority does POTUS have specifically over the Marines?\n\nMarine Corps Law 1834 gives President authority over Marines for any duties President sees fit.\n\nAs outlined in 10 U.S.C. § 5063 and as originally introduced under the National Security Act of 1947, three primary areas of responsibility for the Marine Corps are:Seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land operations to support naval campaigns;Development of tactics, technique, and equipment used by amphibious landing forces in coordination with the Army and Air Force; and Such other duties as the President or Department of Defense may direct.\n\n### Why is this important?\n\nbecause its the Marine Corps responsibility to to protect the president and Us dignitaries abroad . and technically the Marine corps doesn't really protect the president in a direct fashion that is up to the secret service security detail. the Marine Corps does however have the sole responsibility of transporting the president by helicopter to air force one or camp david or anywhere else he may need to go within reach of Marine 1 source.  If answer to #31 is correct, Trump can send in Marines without asking Congress.\n\n### What is Mueller's background? Military?\n\nMueller was accepted for officer training in the \nUnited States Marine Corps in 1968, attending \ntraining at Parris Island, Officer Candidate School, \nArmy Ranger School, and Army jump school.

It is NOT a uniformed CIA, but liaisons with civilian agencies as needed. DIA operates in its own specific interests, coding and decoding enemy transmissions, assesssing enemy troop strengths, and processing intel as it pertains to wars, and the theaters, inc oceans, in which they are fought. Any intel they glean regarding plans of hostiles to harm USA is handeled by a joint operation liaisoning DIA to PENTAGON where the determinations are made in regards to disposition of this intel, and whom, by law, must be informed. All applicable offices liaison within the PENTAGON, thus the intel never physically leaves DIA chain of custody,\n\n### What is 'State Secrets' and how upheld in the SC?\n\nDefined as a test whereby the INT Control determines if it is necessary to protect the Republic and/or population. Can be challenged by SCOTUS under US v Reynolds by rule of majority of the bench.\n\nDocument detailing the procedure for invoking State Secrets privilege:\nhttps://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/legacy/2009/09/23/state-secret-privileges.pdf\n\n### What must be completed to engage MI over other (3) letter agencies?\n\nMI is military, other three-letter agencies are civilian. It would take an act of Congress to suspend Posse Comitatus. Martial law would also work.\n\n### What must occur to allow for civilian trials?\n\nA civilian trial must have a Judge who is willing to hear the case, an Attorney who is willing to prosecute and a Justice Department who is wiling to enforce a Judicial Warrant & Arrest Processing\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nIf all judges are corrupt, as MI / MI6 is finding in Ukraine, its impossible to enforce change. Therefore you must go to Tribunals and either flip the Supreme Court to enforce the proper changes to Arrest the Corrupt, or enact Martial Law and suspend the Criminal Code which is unenforceable so that the Military Code can take over prosecution; Military Tribunal being the backup “Safe Mode” for countries\n\n### What was Flynn's background?\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\n-General Flynn is part of a top secret group of highly skilled retired military operatives who have been investigating human trafficking for years. His company was cover. Flynn KNOWS. \n-He was \"blue-dying\" the GRU political spy network in Washington DC for Army / Navy INT. Sending a mole to light up the recruiters was the only way the FBI / MI5 were able to capture the Cambridge 6\n-POTUS conduit to uncorrupted MI\n-That is why he has been targeted, slandered, fired by Obama, fired on the advice of Pence and now still targeted so they hope he has no credibility.\n\n### Why did Adm R (NSA) meet Trump privately w/o auth?\n\n### Does POTUS know where the bodies are buried?\n\nExclusive: FBI agents raid headquarters of major U.S. body broker\n11-7-17\nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-bodies-fbi-exclusive/exclusive-fbi-agents-raid-headquarters-of-major-u-s-body-broker-idUSKBN1D72SL?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=Social\nhttps://archive.is/Mgf3v\n\n### Does POTUS have the goods on most bad actors?\n\n### Was TRUMP asked to run for President?\n\n### Why?\n\n### By Who?\n\nThe Deep State Patriots and MI Patriots who have been grooming him for years, since they knew he was interested in the possibility.  This is why he knows things nobody else does and is 5 steps ahead of those trying to subvert him.\n\n### Was HRC next in line?\n\nShe had the biggest favors to repay. Soft dollar commissions and political bribes work as a cash in, “political credit” entry ledger system. She took the cash, and promised like any NGO to ensure every favor was earmarked in order for her to get in. Most Democracies function only on who can pay off the most influence centers / “get out the vote” nexus actors. I suspect USA in reality is no different then India or Germany. She was the choice of the NWO\n\n### Was the election suppose to be rigged?\n\nIn a 2004 Congressional Committee on 2014 election and possible tampering with electronic voting machines, a  programmer named Clint Curtis testified that\nin 2000 he was approached by Yang Enterprises and asked to create a program to manipulate vote on electric voting machines to test them. The voter count would flip the loser to the winner, but it would only work if the vote was close. The 2000 election was very close, as was the 2004 election. There is video of his testimony around. There were some electronic voting irregularities in a few districts in the 2016 election, but they were found shortly after because the election wasn't close at all. Wasn't Yang a name that showed up during the Clinton admin in an alleged pay to play?\n\nWe know the voting machines were pre-programmed and people have already been Arrested in California, Nevada and NY State for voting multiple times / voter fraud that were paid for by HRC PAC’s\n\nProof:\n-LA County Admits Number Of Registered Voters At 144%\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-05/california-has-11-counties-more-registered-voters-voting-age-citizens\n\n-US has 35 Million More Registered Voters Than Live Adults - Red Flag for Electoral Fraud\nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-08-18/us-has-35-million-more-registered-voters-live-adults-red-flag-electoral-fraud\n\n### Did good people prevent the rigging?\n\n### Why did POTUS form a panel to investigate?\n\nTo restore our voting process, and highlight the problems that exist in it. Especially the electronic voting machines, but also the usual dems getting the dead and the illegally present in our country to vote.\n\nTo see who really tried to hack election results in 21 states.  \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/us/politics/us-tells-21-states-that-hackers-targeted-their-voting-systems.html\n\"The government did not say who was behind the hacking attempts or provide details about what had been sought. But election officials in several states said the attempts were linked to Russia.\"\n\nWas it really Russia, or were operatives in Deep State doing the hacking under guise of Russia hacking \"fingerprints\" in order to FIX election for Hillary?\n\n### Has POTUS *ever* made a statement that did not become proven as true/fact?\n\n### What is POTUS in control of?\n\nEBS (Emergency Broadcast System) activation, Marshal Law Activation, declare federal level disasters, activate FEMA et al, allocate additional funding & resources\n\n### What is the one organization left that isn't corrupt?\n\nThe Military at large is the most trusted institution in the US, because it is comprised of mostly patriotic and loyal US citizens\n\n### Why does the military play such a vital role?\n\n-The military is under the control of POTUS, and can ACT QUICKLY without checks and balances from other parts of the government in the short term.  The military has corruption (see Naval Intelligence)\n-Military Code can allow for a Jury of Peers or lower Officers to press for the removal of a Executive Officer if he is unfit for Command and be relieved without need for Military Arrest or Serve of Warrant\n\n### Why is POTUS surrounded by highly respected generals?\n\nHe surrounded himself with people he knew he could trust, loyal to the oath.\n\n### Who guards former Presidents?\n\n### Why is that relevant?\n\n### Who guards HRC?\n\nSeptember 16, 2016 at rally in Miami, regarding HRC SS detail, Trump said \"Take their guns away, let's see what happens to her.\"\n\n### Why is ANTIFA allowed to operate?\n\nIt's a useful idiot and malcontent sponge to sop up radicals for monitoring and radicalization. Old FBI SOP from their KKK infiltration days\n\n### Why hasn't the MB been classified as a terrorist org?\n\nIt has significant funding and support from Campus Communist radicals who in turn get funding from Soros and GRU / PRC intelligence accounts; the two having overlapping objectives in destabilizing US morale and education effectiveness; Academics being useful targets due to their desire for ego and adventure / validation\n\n### What happens if Soros funded operations get violent and engage in domestic terrorism?\n\nSoros get hit with Civil Asset Forfeiture, jailed, identified as a terrorist globally.  It will take a small miracle from G&D to penetrate the 12+ shells between Soros and his front charities / useful proxies. If that occurs, tracing to the sourecs would freeze assets and jail him.\n\n### What happens if mayors/ police comms/chiefs do not enforce the law?\n\nWould be forced to declare martial law if State Police could not relieve the local PD & Judicial branch\n\n### What authority does POTUS have specifically over the Marines?\n\nNot just Marines, ALL military branches.  \n\nPOTUS can deploy military fro 60 days and 90 days.  Bush did this after 9-11.  That law was made because it would take too long for congress to declare war if there was an immediate threat.\nWar Powers Resolution, Public Law 93-148\n\n### Why is this important?\n\nPOTUS can \"send in\" any military branch without asking congress.   The important thing about the Marines is they \n1) Have SOME of the transportation duties for POTUS \n2) Guard USA diplomats around the world.\n\nThe above is 60 days to 90 days.     According to section 2 clause 1 of the Constitution the President is \"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States\" and according to Section 8 clause 11 the Congress has the power \"To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water\". Historically the President has be able to use the Marines in any way he wants. They are his personal guard and answer to him.\n\n### What is Mueller's background? Military?\n\n### Was Trump asked to run for President w/ assurances made to prevent tampering?\n\n[SPECULATON] No, that would conflict with the admission WJC asked him to run as a Strawman for HRC\n\n### Who is helping POTUS?\n\n### How is POTUS always 5-steps ahead?\n\nBill Binney is likely assisting the POTUS and team with intelligence. Binney is a legend in meta data analysis and is a co author of a former NSA tool known as ThinThread. Recently Mike Pompeo (CIA) was advised by the POTUS to speak to Binney regarding the Russian hacking investigation. Binney would be able to tell who was responsible by running the data through ThinThread for sure but based on his own development of the algorithm used in the tool he could most likely look at the meta data himself and know. Not only would he know who the actors really were he would be able to develop a very detailed profile with an unknowable reach.\n\nBinney has been very critical of the NSA in the past however, its possible he (nor Snowden, Drake etc) were not aware of an inside threat from with in the government.\n\nBill Binney / ThinThread: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Binney_%28U.S._intelligence_official%29\n\nPOTUS to Pompeo:\nhttp://www.cnn.com/2017/11/07/politics/mike-pompeo-william-binney-meeting/index.html\n\nBinney Documentary:\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4065414/\n\n### Who is helping POTUS?\n\nHere are some of the big names backing POTUS. http://fortune.com/2016/08/03/trump-billionaire-backers-list/\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n","147434025":"## answers\n\n### Warlock Green / Warlock Red Shortstop Electronic Protection System (SEPS) System is capable of prematurely detonating incoming artillery and mortar rounds\n2.\n\nThe Warlock radio frequency jammers are made by the New York and Simi Valley firm EDO.\nhttps://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/an-vlq-9.htm\"\"\n\n### 11.3 - Podesta indicted\n\nTony Podesta\n\nDate given as deliberate misinformation\n\"All warfare is deception\"\n\n### 11.6 - Huma indicted\n\nDate given as deliberate misinformation\n\"All warfare is deception\"\n\n### Manafort was placed into Trump's camp (as well as others).

Only Obama is out of office now, so that would be a violation of the Hatch Act. \n- He would know he must communicate in person, otherwise it will be known and gathered by SIGINT by the NSA. \n- One reason to set up the narrative he wants pushed regarding the trip, also he wants to find an opportunity to have Trump assassinated. \n- To know first hand exactly where POTUS goes while in Asia,  attempting to determine how much he actually knows, depending on who he talks to and where he visits.\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nObama is usurping the President. Treason.\n\n### Focus on the power of POTUS as it relates to the Marines.\n\nMarine Corp is subject to Posse Comitatus (PC) under DoD regulations. POTUS can disregard PC via the Insurrection Act during times of disaster/unrest.\n- He can assign their duties as he sees fit.\n- Posse Comitatus Act only re: Army/AF.

Rage, riots, deaths and chaos. \nD's NEED victims, as it is no use simply shouting fire you must also be the one opening the door you want them to go through\n\n### Why do black elected officials do the crazy talk on behalf of D’s?\n\nSo it's not a white (or a jew) D telling blacks how to vote. \n- Black officials stir up and focus injustice that they themselves provide and do not suffer. It allows events such as the NFL or BLM to occur with apparent spontaneity allowing political pressure to prevent police and destroy authority keeping the Dems to have access to drug trade and other trafficking routes needed by the CIA and FBI\n\n### How do D’s cover the historical facts of forming the confederacy, KKK, and oppose all things pro black re: legislation?\n\n- They tell the lie that the parties switched.\n-Through control of curriculum and textbooks, build the false history\n- Through being the majority of teachers and professors, propagandize and reinforce the propaganda all through a person's education\n-Through audio/visual media, countless movies and documentaries portraying a false history\n- Through \"outreach\" programs and party platform portray their own party as the protector and provider of the black population\n\n### What happens if D’s lose the slave grip on the black pop?\n\nD's lose power forever\n-The Blacks, like Latinos will gravitate back towards the libertarian / right wing (like Ukrainians and Polish did when the USSR lost their hold over the Deep State USSR proxies)\n\n### Why do D’s, through the funding of the CIA, prop up and install Hollywood/media assets?\n\nAnother method of propaganda that gives them easy access to a large portion of the population.\n\nYou need control over the message at all times. Controlling the flow of all news and entertainment in an age of media gives ultimate control.\n\nPolitics is Downstream from Culture.  Hollywood,et al creates popular culture\n\n### Does this fall within Operation Mockingbird?\n\nYes\n\n### What were the historical advantages D’s gained by having MSM and famous people peddling narrative?\n\nControl of propaganda and the narrative.\n\n### Who exposed the pedo network within H wood?\n\n- Ronan Farrow\n- Corey Feldman, though he did not name names until recently.\n- Rose McGowan recently\n- Robert Downy Jr. (as Himmmm on https://CrazyDaysandNights.net) \n- Amy Berg's documentary \"An Open Secret\"\n- Elle Magazine Article: Amy Berg Uncovered Hollywood's Worst Kept Sex Secret\n- Roseanne Barr \n- Pamela Anderson (via Julian Assange and WikiLeaks)\n- Justin Bieber\n- McKulley Kulken\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nDemocrats want to control the black population. They intentionally keep them poor and in need. Democrats project racism on a daily basis against Republicans. Black elected officials do the crazy talk on behalf of Democrats. Democrats cover the historical facts of forming the confederacy, KKK, and oppose all things pro black regarding legislation. What happens if Democrats lose the slave grip on the black pop. Democrats, through the funding of the CIA, prop up and install Hollywood/media assets. This does fall within Operation Mockingbird.\n\nThere are historical advantages that Democrats gained by having MSM and famous people peddling the narrative. Someone exposed the pedophile network within Hollywood.\n\n## extra answers\n\n### Why does Obama travel in advance of POTUS to foreign locations?\n\n[Theory] Obama & Valerie work with local CIA rogue elements and patsy political operatives to promote malcontent and hinder State Dept diplomacy. \n- Acts as a “shadow government” to create conflict ex: call in “favors” from judges, as seen in Immigration Ban with judge from Hawaii. Money laundering as seen with Clinton Foundation.\n- \"...effective September 1, 2017, US Passports were invalidated for travel into, on, or through North Korea.\" Implying that Obama either traveled to NK illegally, had Trump's approval, or did not travel on a US passport.\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nNote that Sessions shut off 2 illegal and unconstitutional SLUSH FUNDS, one belonging to the DOJ, and another to the EPA.

Also, other connections could be revealed depending on where Obama goes and who he talks to.

Nellar answers to DOD Chief Mattis, also USMC ret.  Mattis answers to POTUS.  The center of power is Washngton D.C.  District of.Columbia is not a State.  Marines can and will protect the center of power.  \n\nAs outlined in 10 U.S.C. § 5063 and as originally introduced under the National Security Act of 1947, three primary areas of responsibility for the Marine Corps are:\n1. Seizure or defense of advanced naval bases and other land operations to support naval campaigns;\n2. Development of tactics, technique, and equipment used by amphibious landing forces in coordination with the Army and Air Force; and\n3. Such other duties as the President or Department of Defense may direct.\n\nThis last clause derives from similar language in the Congressional acts \"For the Better Organization of the Marine Corps\" of 1834, and \"Establishing and Organizing a Marine Corps\" of 1798. In 1951, the House of Representatives' Armed Services Committee called the clause \"one of the most important statutory – and traditional – functions of the Marine Corps.\" It noted that the Corps has more often than not performed actions of a non-naval nature, including its famous actions in Tripoli, the War of 1812, Chapultepec, and numerous counter-insurgency and occupational duties.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps\n\n### How can MI be applied to prosecute bad actors and avoid corrupt agencies and judges?\n\n### Why did Mueller meet POTUS 1-day prior to FBI announcement if Mueller COULD NOT be offered director due to prev term limits rule?\n\nRobert Mueller was a former Special Prosecutor who worked on complex financial fraud cases with UK Intelligence’s Special Crimes / Major Crimes Unit. He worked on tracking international money laundering, specifically targeting the Chinese Pay to Play crimes in the 1990’s\n\n### Why is Pelosi begging for a new special counsel?\n\nPelosi and Frank were 4 of the largest money laundering conduits for the 2001-2008 \nsubprime scandal, Pelosi also has been under investigation for major green card fraud, most of which was sponsored by major tech / DARPA backed tech oligarchs\n\n### What is Pelosi’s net worth?\n\n### How was this obtained given salary as career official?\n\n### Why is Pelosi’s memory going?\n\nnon compos mentis (not mentally capable)\n\nPelosi suffers brain freeze while questioning Trump's fitness to be President\nhttp://www.theamericanmirror.com/pelosi-suffers-brain-freeze-questioning-trumps-fitness-president/\n\n### Could it protect against prosecution?\n\nnon compos mentis (not mentally capable)\n\n### What is the Mayo Clinic?\n\nA VIP hospital who works on Heads of State and anyone who can pay for a surgery which may not be legal under medical insurance / surgeon boards. This is important when working on foreign heads of state who may be legally not allowed to enter the USA.Add: Doc here, the Mayo clinic is revered as the world 'center' of surgical excellence. If you are a foreign billionaire this is where you would pay to go.\n\n### Who sits on the BOD there?\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/governance/trustees\n\n### What if John M's surgery was fake?\n\nYes, without question. John is still working great on the Intelligence Committee. \n-Doc here.. I am not a neurosurgeon but his rapid recovery suggests that he didn't actually have anything significant done. As this trick applies to Pelosi, claim memory loss, dementia etc so they can’t testify.\n\n### Why would this occur?\n\nNB - As Criminal Scandals Implicating McCain Unfold 'Declining' Health Has Become an Off-Broadway Production\nhttp://truepundit.com/as-criminal-scandals-implicating-mccain-unfold-declining-health-has-become-an-off-broadway-production/\n\n### What could this prevent potentially?\n\nJon would either be forced to admit the Congressional Intelligence Committee is compromised and by extension the CIA/NSA/FBI/DNI/NRO were also compromised since 1991 (which would have explained the large layoffs and retribution for the success in Yugoslavia by Russian/Chinese actors) or commit perjury.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n### >>147443190\n\nID:grTMpzrL Wed 01 Nov 2017 00:29:28\n\n### Why do D’s want to control the black pop?\n\nCommunists in 1940 theorized that the Blacks were the Ukrainians of USA. They lacked a way to infiltrate because nobody knew how Black Culture worked. Democrats always needed a useful idiot class to be their “Bohemian Majority” and be their Useful idiots to sway the Overton Window leftward.\n\n### Why do they intentionally keep poor and in need?\n\nDependency on the Government and in return they are controllable\n\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs. If you are too busy worrying about basic needs, you don't think long term or in terms of moral parameters.\n\n### Why do D’s project racism on a daily basis against R’s?\n\n-Alinsky \"Rules for Radicals\" 101: Project to deflect\n-Division is strategy for conquering a people. -Division can also lead to civil war/unrest -- from that \"crisis\" arises the \"demand\" for a new world government to \"save\" us.\n\n### Why do black elected officials do the crazy talk on behalf of D’s?\n\nThe Black Caucus are all bribed and paid off, which was the whole reason the Blacks were allowed into office under Rev. Al Sharpton’s Pac network, financed by the big Tobacco DNC interests circa 1990\n\n### How do D’s cover the historical facts of forming the confederacy, KKK, and oppose all things pro black re: legislation?\n\nMost U.S.history textbooks in US public middle, high schools and universities have a liberal slant.  For example, the \"Radical Republicans\" of  the Reconstruction era are painted in a subtly negative light, so as to infer \"40 acres and a mule\" for slave restitution was a bad thing. Similarly most, but not all, public school teachers are of a liberal bent and their union PACs always endorse Democrats.  Public schools have thus become well-oiled propaganda machines breeding and ensuring massive liberal mindsets effectively indoctrinating the young people with propaganda and a mindset that is in harmony with the cabal's agenda.  Investigating the names of the editors of a textbook will reveal their political leanings and explain why the textbook is politicized.\n\n### What happens if D’s lose the slave grip on the black pop?\n\n### Why do D’s, through the funding of the CIA, prop up and install Hollywood/media assets?\n\nOnly thing money can not control is spread of truth online. This combined with memetics, Streissand efect and the fact, that viral content can exponentially multiply, cause the truth to spread faster than any \"fake news truth\" can be spread on shill media.\n\n### Does this fall within Operation Mockingbird?\n\nIt's become very obvious that the media immediately calls up people like Al Sharpton to crow about grievances and accuse anyone who questions their narrative as being a racist bigot. Every single issue that can be twisted to condition the black population into thinking the \"white mans system\" is out to get them is employed by these \"race-baiters\" the media puts forth. It is obvious that it is coordinated.\n\n### What were the historical advantages D’s gained by having MSM and famous people peddling narrative?\n\nCult of Personality and Endorsement are circular references since the 1940’s and the “Camelot Presidency”. Without manipulating consumer preferences and consumption habits, it’s hard to gain the populations trust on tougher concepts like wealth destruction and tax hikes\n\n### Who exposed the pedo network within H wood?\n\nAmy Berg, Director of \"Open Secret\" (2014) Oscar nominated for Deliver Us From Evil about an Irish priest pedophile for which she was Oscar nominated. Producers with the original Hollywood pedophile idea for the film were Gabe Hoffman (hedge fund mgr) and Michael Valentinas (entertainment lawyer) who said \"I came up with the idea hearing Corey Feldman talk about what he'd been through,\" referring to Feldman's revelations in interviews that he and others had been sexually abused as child actors.  \nsource: http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/news/a19842/true-detective/\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n","147444934":"## answers\n\n### I’ve dumped some crumbs like this over the weekend which started the intense shilling.

The meetings with the non-military (civilian) could have included the military, however, the military's own meeting would not have included the non-military.\n\n### Why were certain rooms in the WH renovated? Clear bugs and tracking devices.\n\nBecause numerous leaks came out of Trump's meetings in the WH starting after inauguration, and phone calls were leaked too.

In churches, on campuses, in classrooms, in public meetings, they took notes, tape-recorded, and photographed people who dissented in thought, word, or deed. This included clergymen, editors, public officials, and anyone who sympathized with the dissenters.\nhttp://digitalcommons.law.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6053&context=lalrev\n\n>Hahahaha, Trump has had MI infiltrate Antifa and all the dissenting local govts. \n\nAlways 5 steps ahead!\n\nPlease be true.\n\n### Well done.

Both elected and un-elected individuals who exert massive influence in U.S. Government. These entities answer to no one but each other and therefore maintain a \"shadow\" government.

Part of this funding arises through the zakat (an act of charity dictated by Islam) paid by all Saudis to charities, and amounting to at least 2.5% of their income. Although many charities are genuine, others allegedly serve as fronts for money laundering and terrorist financing operations. While many Saudis contribute to those charities in good faith believing their money goes toward good causes, it has been alleged that others know full well the terrorist purposes to which their money will be applied.\"\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nIt shows that SA is buying influence/attaining power in our government.\n\n### What else is relevant w/ SA?\n\nSA is a safe harbor for globalists?\n\n### Safe harbor?\n\nYes\n\n### Port of transfer?\n\nYes.\n\n### Why was there a recent smear campaign against JK and POTUS?\n\nNigeria (ostensibly)\n-Misdirection\n\n### Why is the timing important?\n\nProximity of smear to JK's trip to KSA\n\n### Who released the article?\n\nBreitbart\n\n### The council of Wizards & Warlocks cannot be defeated.\n\nWizards and Warlocks, Council of Wizards NSA group\n\n### Nice view up here.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nFind John Podesta.

That's how they do it.\n\n### Who is the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) head?\n\n- He served 33 years of active military duty, including one year (2009-2010) as the Vice Commandant (second in command) of the Coast Guard\n- Coast Guard is under DHS\n- Pekoske was installed under the Trump administration.\n\n### Which party did he contribute to?\n\n### What is of particular interest when researching?\n\nHis female deputy director pops into DHS in 2000 at high level, Iranian descent, moves quickly up chain to oversight of aviation security and nuclear matters. Too fast, too directed, no political donations listed.\n\n### How does HS interact w/ TSA?\n\n### What updated post 9-11 protocols were put in place to prevent/stop inbound/outbound C-level targets?\n\n(Not sure what a \"c level threat is, but this is a list of some of the post 9-11 changes.) Since the new regulations came fairly quickly, the goals were set in short and long terms. According to Jim Abrams, some of the short term goals included \"criminal background checks on 750,000 airport employees, the presence of more law enforcement, the screening of all checked baggage with whatever means available, including X-ray machines and hand inspections, the placement of more air marshals on flights, and more passengers will be pre-screened, with more cross-checking with FBI and other watch lists for suspicious passengers\" (2001). As of 2003, the department of Homeland Security, headed by Tom Ridge, made the decision to increase the number of air marshals by 5,000 (Regional, 2003). Those short-term affects were to happen within the first year of implementation. The long term affects of the new security on airlines were: \"A new Transportation Department agency put in place to oversee all transportation security measures, all 28,000 airport baggage screeners [are] federal workers, all checked baggage is to be inspected with explosives detection machines, [and] Trusted-passenger programs will be implemented, using new technologies to identify passengers and expedite screening\" (Abrams, 2001). Most of the new regulations proposed security of the baggage and the passengers on the plane. According to the TSA, as quoted in the article by Gerald L. Dillingham, \"[The TSA has] confiscated more than 4.8 million prohibited items (including firearms, knives, and incendiary or flammable objects) from passengers\" (2003, p. 8). The Department of Homeland Security has also backed up this fact by stating \"airport screeners have, since February 2002, intercepted more than 7.8 million items, including 1,437 firearms, 2.3 million knives, and 49,331 box cutters - the terrorists' weapon of choice on 9-11. Attempts at concealment included razor blades hidden in tennis shoes\" (Gips, 2003). http://www.ifpo.org/resource-links/articles-and-reports/protection-of-specific-environments/the-evolution-of-airline-security-since-911/\n\n### What local airports are in close proximity to DC?\n\n### What happened shortly after 9-11 (specifically with all aircraft)?\n\nFAA Rapid Response Team on Aircraft Security created, recommends the hardening of existing cockpit doors and expediting the design, production and installation of new doors.\n\n### Who was authorized to depart? ONLY 1 PLANE was authorized during this 'mandatory forced grounding'.\n\nThere were several flights.\n\nThe first leg of this flight took place at 1:30pm. The purpose of this leg was to bring young Saudi noblemen studying in Florida from Raytheon Airport Services, a private jet hangar at TPA (Tampa INT) to Blue Grass Airport (LEX GA). The airplane was a 10-person Learjet. There is no manifest or record. The FAA claims this flight did not occur and has no record of it despite sworn affidavits that it did occur by Federal personnel.\n\nAt the same time, several other flights to transport Saudi noblemen and princes were authorized by FAA with the eventual goal of transporting these individuals, which included Osama Bin Ladin's sister, to Las Vegas for a direct flight.\n\nhttps://www.salon.com/2004/03/11/unger_1/\n\n### Who SPECIFICALLY authorized this?\n\nBen Sliney on first day of the job. He was a lawyer for 20 years, came back to the FAA in 2000, and was specialized in air traffic flow (meaning he was guaranteed to decide to ground planes, an extra-ordinary measure, but logical from an air traffic flow perspective).\n\n### What airport did the departure take place at?\n\nMcCarren Airport Las Vegas was one of two bin laden flights (the other NY)\nhttps://www.salon.com/2004/03/11/unger_1/\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nLV has significance because Saudi princes also allegedly escaped from this airport after the LV massacre.\n\n### How does it tie together?\n\n### Podesta's plane has military escort (i.e. tag) and is being diverted (forced down).\n\n### Short delay.\n\n### This will be leaked.\n\n### Watch the news.\n\n### Have faith.\n\n### What fake news anchor will not be on air tonight?\n\nErin Burnett is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.[3]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Burnett\n\nHer Husband , finance executive David Rubulotta,  was previously a trader for Lehman Brothers[32] and is currently a managing director for Citigroup.(SA Prince connection)\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nCooper, son of Vanderbilt.

Also shields Soros' fortune from estate tax upon George's death (which clearly he is eluding via 'special' medical treatment)\n\n### Can it be used by bad actors (escape, bribes, rogue contractors, etc.)?\n\n### Slush fund?\n\nCharity watchdog: Clinton Foundation a ‘slush fund’\nhttp://nypost.com/2015/04/26/charity-watchdog-clinton-foundation-a-slush-fund/\n\n### Did the US gov't seize/stop/track other slush funds that prevent or create risk to operate?\n\n### Why did JK travel to SA recently?\n\nNegotiating Peace in the Middle East: Key to solving that dispute is Egypt.

Not trusted to protect POTUS. Minimize chance of 'internal' assassination attempts'. Signal to others / warning to SS - awareness of compromised SS? Military not corrupt\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nTo show that Trump has the full backing of the Military and that the Military can be trusted to be around Trump.\n\nBefore Trump's inauguration, Obama tried to rally the Military behind him, to prevent Trump from taking office.  But that failed when Obama realizes that Trump already has the full backing of the military.\n\n### Do military guards (uniform) typically assist the USSS?\n\nDuring wartime the US SS needs the assistance of the MI to be effective.  \"Protecting the president of the United States is a mission that should be carried out and presided over by only the most highly qualified individuals.

The number of governments contributing in 2014 appears to have doubled from the previous year. Since its founding, the foundation has raised at least $48 million from overseas governments, according to a Journal tally. United Arab Emirates, a first-time donor, gave between $1 million and $5 million in 2014, and the German government—which also hadn’t previously given—contributed between $100,000 and $250,000. A previous donor, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has given between $10 million and $25 million since the foundation was created in 1999. Part of that came in 2014, although the database doesn’t specify how much. The Australian government has given between $5 million and $10 million, at least part of which came in 2014. It also gave in 2013, when its donations fell in the same range. Qatar’s government committee preparing for the 2022 soccer World Cup gave between $250,000 and $500,000 in 2014. Qatar’s government had previously donated between $1 million and $5 million. Oman, which had made a donation previously, gave an undisclosed amount in 2014. Over time, Oman has given the foundation between $1 million and $5 million.

On 8 May 2008, al-Waleed gave £16 million to Edinburgh University to fund a \"centre for the study of Islam in the contemporary world.\"[59] He has also endowed the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Center for American Studies and Research (CASAR).[60] The Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medical College is named for al-Waleed.[61] The Centre of Islamic Studies at the University of Cambridge also bears the name of Al-Waleed,[62] and the Islamic Studies Program at Harvard University are also named for him.\n\n### Why did Alwaleed finance BO pre-political days?\n\n### Why did Alwaleed finance BO pre-political days?\n\n### What is HUMA?

During that tumultuous period, an influx of radical black Muslim groups had begun to headquarter in Chicago, and Trinity sought to recontextualize Christianity through black theology in order to counter the influence of radical black Muslim leaders, who taught that it was impossible to be both black and Christian. (WIKIPEDIA)\n\n### Who was BO’s mentor?\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski, was a teacher of BO at Columbia and recruited him into Business International Corporation, a CIA front company\n\n### How is Alwaleed and HRC connected?\n\nThrough mutual CFR friend Sandy Weill who repealed the Glass-Steagall Act. Citigroup raised $12.5 billion in convertible preferred stock in a private placement with Talal, after private meetings with the Federal Reserve. With a market cap of $20.5 billion on Friday, November 21, 2008, the U.S. taxpayer effectively owned this compan. Our government's bailout program was in the hands of his crony New York Fed, where Sandy Weill had served as a Director from 2001 through 2006, and the U.S. Treasury Department, run at that point by Hank Paulson, formed CEO of Goldman Sachs. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and New York Fed President Timothy Geithner held a conference call with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, and Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan (a former bank lobbyist) to discuss Citigroup. Sanford Weill is the pen Council on Foreign Relations member Bill Clinton used to sign the REPEAL of FDR's Banking Act. Later, Clinton Foundation hired Kevin Thurm as its executive vice president. Thurm served as a Citigroup executive for more than a decade.\n\n### Who was HRC’s mentor?\n\nHenry Kissinger\n\n### How is Alwaleed and Bush Sr./Jr. connected?\n\nCarlyle Group.

This was a direct challenge/threat to the Petrodollar system. \n- No Petrodollar System = Greatly devalued $US Dollar = Inflation Shock on US Economy = Severe recession or maybe collapse.\n\n- Saddam was also challenging OPEC and KSA leadership/hegemony in ME.

He founded the Saudi Binladin Group (Saudi Binladin Group), a construction company that made him and his family a fortune by virtue of his relationship with Faisal of Saudi Arabia. Faisal reigned as monarch until his death in 1975, and granted Bin Laden's company exclusive rights to all construction projects undertaken by the Saudi Arabian government.  \nSOURCE: https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-connection-between-Osama-bin-Laden-Saudi-Royal-Family-Bush-family-9-11\n\n### Who in SA is connected specifically to the Bin Laden family?\n\nFaisal of Saudi Arabia (King)\n\n### What did they deliver?\n\nOsama bin Laden\n\n### To who?\n\n### Why?\n\nProtection\n\n### What does money buy?\n\nPolitical influence and control.

This is generally how muslim men justify prostitution. Big problem in India. These temp marriages can last ffor up to 2 months.\n\n### Think SA.\n\n---\n\n### How does FB & Instagram play a role in capture?\n\n- Broadcasts location. \n- Virtual meat-market of unwitting subjects/slaves. \n- Gullible people telegraph to the world their personal details.\n- Insta Models advertise escort services\n\n### Think ‘Taken’.\n\nMovie in which young white American girl is nabbed in Paris, and put on drugs (opiods) to sell in an auction, involving wealthy Arabs, without her consent obviously.\n\n### Fantasy right?\n\nIt may seem like this situation is only a sick fantasy but it is correct and true.\n\n### Why do select senior political officials have foundations/institutes?\n\nThis is how they can receive millions in bribes without raising suspicion or violating US law. \n- This is how senior US Congressmen/women can and do amass vast wealth (tens or hundreds of millions) on a salary of less than $200k/year. or \n-  as McCain Foundation has a division for trafficking, it also has a division for 'rescue' allowing them to be able to dispose of noncompliant within their own organization, legally and where they appear heros.

Paper trail.\n\n### How do you avoid public misconception?\n\n- DIRECT COMMUNICATION, evidence, transparency.\n- Bypass the Narrative setters, expose those who have kept people in the dark in order to cover up.\n- Demonstrate how they have misrepresented themselves. \n- Leak the story beforehand\n\n### How do you justify counter-political attacks to the mass public?\n\nNational Security, connect them with the most vile & indefensible thing there is: child sex abuse/exploitation\nIT HAS TO BE TRUE THOUGH\n\n### Why is information so vital?\n\nJustify why accused aren't being politically persecuted but are genuinely bad actors, and have acted against the country itself, not just trivial corruption, personal foibles.\n\n### Is the country divided?\n\nDivide & conquer, decades of indoctrination via cultural Marxism to fulfill an agenda, resulting in two distinct world experiences and therefore world views.\n\n### Why does the MSM portray the country as being divided?\n\n- Control, to help along the fracturing of the nation.\n- Distraction from perpetrators in Gov, Media, Corps. Destabilization\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nMedia, many beholden to KSA bad actors will attempt to present a narrative that any prosecutions of US polticians/businesspersons are the result of a vicious, political persecution program, Trump is \"literally Hitler\" and exploit real and manufactured divisions with the US populace in order to minimize the damage to the accused bad actors.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\nOne family was permitted to leave immediately after 9-11. Someone authorized the departure. No one else was permitted to leave. It was a private plane. What can private planes carry v commercial? What airport did they arrive/depart from.

The money buys something.\n\nThe events in Saudi Arabia are relevant to the above. Someone is the financial backer for human trafficking. Someone is the 'broker' for underage sex. Think Saudi Arabia. FB & Instagram plays a role in the capture. Think 'Taken'. Fantasy, right? Select senior political officials have foundations/institutes for a reason. Look at money laundering. The money buys something. Other people were arrested in Saudi Arabia. Look at their backgrounds. They are connected to the Podesta Group. You need something in order to prosecute senior political officials. You must avoid public misconception. You must justify counter-political attacks to the mass public. information is so vital.

Raytheon, of course, is the massive arms manufacturer that supplied many of the high-tech weapons used in Afghanistan and Iraq. Tampa is also near Venice FL, where Mad Cow Morning News has exposed numerous secrets about the training of 9-11 pilots Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi at shadowy local flight schools. And Tampa is in Florida, where Gov. Jeb Bush stole the 2000 election for his brother George, and where Jeb issued Executive Order 2001-261 to prepare the FL National Guard for a terrorist attack on 9-7-01.)\"\n\n... It seems that in spite of the fact that Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz and his government have been accused of funding charities linked to Al Qaeda, James Baker's firm still feels the need to defend the Prince against those \"evil\" trial lawyers representing the orphaned families of the 9-11 victims.\n\nBut perhaps what is just as shocking to me is the allegation that the son of this SAME Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz was reportedly flown out of the United States\n\n... But then the jet flew to New Orleans \"to pick up someone who needed a ride to New York.\" So this plane made AT LEAST 5 flights on 9-13, but the FAA told the Tampa Tribune, \"it's not in our logs... it didn't occur.\" \n\nFrom: http://archive.democrats.com/view.cfm?id=14289\n\n### Was it a private plane?\n\n### What can private planes carry v commercial?\n\nAll sorts of stuff not allowed on commercial flights http://www.pjsgroup.com/why-travel-with-us/carry-on-regulations/\n\n### What airport did they arrive/depart from?\n\nFt.

Ideologically separated by media & perceptions, echo chambers. Day-to-day not much conflict among normal citizens. Only when you compare the usual liberal hotspots to the rest of the (less-vocal) population. The MSM makes the liberal presence seem far more powerful than it currently is.\n\n### Why does the MSM portray the country as being divided?\n\nDestabilization with the objective of creating chaos and panic, following which citizens will be more open to further loss of freedoms in the name of 'safety'.\n\n### Why is this relevant?\n\nIt creates a false reality for people still reliant on Mockingbird media.

SA's reserves are drying up; their GDP% is in decline; Deficit % of GDP is -19.5% in 2015 (down from +12 in 2012); Salman might be desperate enough to reach out to Muslim Brotherhood - but Salman proposed an offer to open up Saudi for American investments \"in the tune of an absurd $2 trillion over coming year\"\nLink to that email: https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/39143\n\n### What US assets are in place in/near SA?\n\nQatar hosts the largest US military presence in the region.\nSource:\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/05/middleeast/qatar-us-largest-base-in-mideast/index.html\n\n### What assurances were made to protect the Kingdom?\n\nSaudi Arabia is one of America’s largest foreign creditors to the tune of ~$120 billion which stems back to a deal between Nixon and King Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud made in 1974 which the King demanded remain secret. The U.S. would buy oil from Saudi Arabia and provide the kingdom military aid and equipment. In return, the Saudis would plow petrodollar revenue back into U.S. Treasuries.  Saudi Arabia also agreed that the U.S. dollar would be used in all oil trade.  This increased demand.\n\n### Who shot down the missile from Yemen?\n\nQ said \"we\" shot it down (i.e., the USA)\n\nAlso, on top of all the other arms contracts that SA has with the US, they just agreed to buy THAAD for 15 billion. \n\n- https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-missiles/u-s-approves-possible-15-billion-sale-of-thaad-missiles-to-saudi-arabia-idUSKBN1CB2IN\n\n### POTUS declassify_speech_Jap_11_5\n\nPOTUS speech on Texas shooting: cadence off, abnormal pauses at various points.

(MS13)(Votes)(187)\n\n### Why is open border important?\n\n- To allow the illegals into the US\n- Can't import massive numbers of third-worlders legitimately/legally without popular revolt. \n- Open borders ensures that there is NO vetting whatsoever of who gets in, no tracking, no ability to control the state of the nation and its direction. \n- It also allows for new D “voters” and more voter fraud, pushes down wages and alienates the (founding stock) public ever more from govt – lowering confidence in govt and society with withdrawal from the social space allows foreigners to take more control of culture and exert more influence.\n\n### What did BO say on the campaign trail last year to illegals within the US?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-WX5S0-Pbk\n\n-He stated that the voter rolls and the citizenship rolls are not cross checked.

He is related to 20 British Dukes, the 13th cousin of Britain’s Queen Mother, and of her daughter Queen Elizabeth. He is 13th cousin once removed from Prince Charles and has direct descent from King Henry III, Charles II, and Edward I of England. “Father George and wife Barbara [Bush] are both descendants of Godfroi de Bouillon who, in 1099, led European noblemen in the successful Crusade to recapture Jerusalem from the Islamic faith and moved into the King’s palace at Temple Mount … Godfroi de Bouillon was the first king of Jerusalem and the Duke of Lower Lorraine, a major region for the Illuminati bloodline\n\n### What happened during WWII?\n\nEuropean powers fought with Russia and America against Germany, Italy and Japan.\n\n### Was Hitler a puppet?\n\nIn the beginning yes.

The physical appearance of each body—height, weight, age, hair and eye colour, visible birthmarks, scars or tattoos, was catalogued and any personal effects on the bodies were gathered and placed in small canvas bags corresponding to their number. (It was decided to preserve all bodies of First Class passengers because of the need to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates)\n\n### When were tickets purchased for her maiden voyage?\n\n1. In July of 1911, White Star and Harland & Wolff announced a date for Titanic's maiden voyage - March 20, 1912. \n\nSeptember 20, 1911: Titanic's maiden voyage delayed due to necessary diversion of workers and materials to repair Olympic. \n\nOctober 11, 1911: White Star officially announces new date for Titanic's maiden voyage in the London Times - April 10, 1912. \n\nThis information leads me to believe that tickets would not have been sold before July, 1911 (when the first date was announced). It seems to make sense, also, that ticket sales would slow or stop when construction was interrupted; then ticket sales might pick up again after the Oct. 11, 1911, announcement of the new launch date. \n\n2. According to the second link I have given below, Joseph Laroche purchased tickets for his family in March, 1912. \n\n3. According to the third link below, one family was transferred to the Titanic when the ship they were ticketed for was cancelled. This transfer happened \"in the spring of 1912,\" which at least tells us that the Titanic was not sold out by spring. \n\n4.

He and a colleague were supposedly offered free passage on the Titanic by a White Star Line official interested in their work but declined and instead took the more humble liner Lapland.\n\nThe Italian inventor, wireless telegraphy pioneer and winner of the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics was offered free passage on Titanic but had taken the Lusitania three days earlier.\n\n### Less than 10.\n\nAlfred Gwynne Vanderbilt I also, Someone in their family objected to their sailing aboard the new ship, “because so many things can go wrong on a maiden voyage.”\n\n### What is the FED?\n\nConsortium of private central banks in the US.\n\n### What does the FED control?\n\nUS monetary policy, including interest rates.\n\n### Who controls the FED?\n\nRothschilds\n\n### Who approved the formation of the FED?\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\n### Why did H-wood glorify Titanic as a tragic love story?\n\nTo hide history / distract from the fact the last 3 major opponents of the FED died that night.\n\n### Who lived in the movie (what man)?\n\nThis line of questions suggest someone famous was shown to have survived in the movie but in reality died that night and his identity was stolen.\nPossible list\nJack Thayer\nWilliam Ernest Carter\nGeorge Dunton Widener\nHarry Elkins Widener\nJ.

Show that their fears are false and they have no power.\n\n### Why does the US Military play such a vital role in this global game of RISK?\n\n-Most powerful military in the world with global force projection.\n-Advanced technology and weapons system, some not yet made public. We have bases all over the world.\n\n### What is money without power?\n\nPaper with which to buy luxury goods.\n\n### Why did POTUS depart Manila 30 min ahead of schedule?\n\n### Why is AF1 landing in Hawaii?\n\nHome to United States Pacific Command and Fleet.\n\n### Does AF1 have in-air refueling ability?\n\n### Nothing is as it appears.\n\n### What is the nickname for DC?\n\n### What was the DC vote breakdown between Trump & Clinton?\n\n### Why would sealed indictments be outside of DC jurisdiction?\n\n-DC jurisdiction too deeply involved in the Swamp\n-Jury and judge selection will greatly vary.  Allows for greater ease of attack, from all sides.  Greatly increases complexity of defense in law if a target is legally pressed from every direction.\n\n### What purpose would this serve?\n\n-Prevent Congress from overturning any of the indictments\n-Remove the litigation from the corrupt DC judges.  Decentralizing removes the ability to easily control.\n-To prevent bad DC elements from manipulating and/or leaking info.\n\n### Why are judicial appointments being rapidly completed?\n\nSo Trump's nominees are seated Federal Judges when these indictments come down and the cases are litigated.  This increases our chances of having a non-corrupt Federal Judge preside over these criminal cases.\n\n### Who can you trust?\n\n### Have faith, Patriots.\n\n### SUMMARY\n\n","149402892":"## answers\n\n### RESPONDING TO >>149402286\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/930490487903084544 (embed)\ndid anyone saw this in the vid?\n\n### Isn't that curious?\n\n### What's below?\n\n## extra answers\n\n### RESPONDING TO >>149402286\n\n11/14/17(Tue)13:02:04\n\n### Isn't that curious?\n\n### What's below?\n\n","149467638":"## answers\n\n### For the coming days ahead.\n\n### Ask yourself an honest question, why would a billionaire who has it all, fame, fortune, a warm and loving family, friends, etc. want to endanger himself and his family by becoming POTUS?\n\n### Why would he want to target himself and those he cares about?\n\nBecause he cares more for the people he serves.\n\n### Does he need money?\n\nNo\n\n### Does he need fame?\n\nNo\n\n### What does he get out of this?\n\nThe joy and satisfaction of saving this great country from evil and destruction; the ability to sleep at night knowing that he's risen to the immense challenge before us and that he's done what he has been prepared his entire life to accomplish.\n\n### Does he want to make the US/world a better place for his family and for those good and decent people who have long been taken advantage of?\n\nYes\n\n### Perhaps he could not stomach the thought of mass murders occurring to satisfy Moloch?\n\n### Perhaps he could not stomach the thought of children being kidnapped, drugged, and raped while leaders/law enforcement of the world turn a blind eye.\n\nPerhaps he has been around it, to a degree and knows people in those circles.

The public is not symbol literacy and therefore when the symbols are seen they are not understood, so there is no risk to displaying them openly.\n- It is a method of signaling to others that they are part of an in-group and should be greeted and treated accordingly.\n\n### Their need for symbolism will be their downfall.\n\nWearing or openly displaying their symbols not only identifies them to \"friendly\" others (members within the network or of a particular cult) but it likewise identifies them to our Patriots and allies who are working to clean out the corruption and filth of this network of bad actors worldwide.\n\n### MSM role?\n\nThe MSM's role is to label \"truth\" a conspiracy theory.blind the people and make this type of 'entertainment' normal, therefore providing power to the ones 'holding the ritual'\n\n### Push conspiracy theory.\n\nThe 'conspiracy theory' label is used to marginalize alternative viewpoints and anyone who researches and finds information on topics that are dangerous or threatening to this network of bad actors and cult members.\n\n### Social media role?\n\nTo enforce conformity of thought and attitude, world-view in culture. It elevates some persons and showcases (promotes) certain ideas and ideals, while hiding, suppressing and censoring anything counter to that approved worldview (in accord with the agenda of the cabal and their network of bad actors).\n\nSocial media role is to \"not trend\" or delete anything that is not sanctioned and is therefore labeled a conspiracy theory, thereby suppressing the truth.\n\n### Push conspiracy theory and institute new rules allowing for ban.\n\nThe conspiracy theory pushed by social media companies is that there is a nefarious plot by \"far-right\" elements to oppress and degrade minorities, therefore anyone who does not wholeheartedly believe in and support enforced diversity and multiculturalism is an evil person who is a \"Nazi\" or sympathizer. This allows them to paint broad swaths of people with a brush and enact policies to silence any dissent from the accepted (promoted) view. The new censorship rules will allow monitoring (surveillance) not only off-site but also offline for behavior that is not in conformity with their Terms of Service and they will ban a large amount of users to enforce the echo-chamber they have created.\n\nAny views or news labeled \"Conspiracy theory\" is manually prevented by companies from \"Trending\".

Without that protection they are vulnerable and that can be exploited to gain information for prosecution of themselves and/or others in this network.\n\n### Necessary to form WW alliances to defeat.\n\nIt's necessary to ally with countries you might not expect in order to pool information, resources and coordinate a worldwide operation to cleanse our countries of the filth that is the network of bad actors.\n\nLink with China, Russia, and those in SA who have chosen to get on the right side of things\n\n### Think Merkel is a coincidence?\n\nReferring to the Refusal of the potential coalition parties to form the coalition (due to differences). Will most likely result in snap elections where Merkel is expected to suffer further losses or even defeat (She is a globalist and responsible for the mass migrant influx in Germany). The AFD (Alternativ fur Deuchland) party (anti globalist) would most likely become stronger in a reelection.\n\nFor now the news are writing that Merkel is thinking about a minority government.\n\nThere are no coincidences.\n\nAfter the Elections in Germany the SPD decided not to form  a Coalition with Merkel. Now they are thinking of it again. So they don't know anything about this. Germans have been kept in the dark for 70 years, fed lies and were told they are to blame for the two World Wars.\n\n### They are puppets.\n\nPoliticians in many countries are not the ones in control or with the actual power, such as Merkel.\n\n### They are weak.\n\nThey are personally weak, i.e., corruptible. They are politically weak, i.e., they are puppets.\n\n### They are scared.\n\nThe puppets are afraid that they lose the protection of and funds from their puppeteers. Without that protection, they are vulnerable to prosecution for their bad acts. Without the funds they cannot themselves pay bribes or blackmail money, or their lavish lifestyle to which they have become accustomed.\n\nWith the cutting of the strings between puppets and puppeteers, some of the lackeys and minions will no doubt exchange information for a plea deal or immunity from prosecution. The very real fear is that there will be a percentage who will talk and share information, but no one knows who is talking and who isn't, therefore fear and panic set in as no one knows how close to being caught one is.\n\n### 80% dark ops necessary.\n\nThe vast majority of acts in the operation will take place out of the public eye. We will never hear of it or see it, but it is necessary to do it this way to prevent panic by the public, collapse of industries and the global financial system, and potentially to prevent military acts by countries or groups who would capitalize on that destablized situation and potential chaos.\n\n### 20% public for justice.\n\nA smaller amount of action will be taken publicly, sweeping up bad actors for arrest and prosecution so that the public can still have or gain confidence in the justice system.\n\n20% of bad actors will be removed PUBLICALLY - in court. To establish trust in the rule of law. 80% will be taken out secretly \"black ops\", or else it would overwhelm the justice system.\n\n### The stage must be set.\n\nCertain events must occur in a particular order in order for other things to transpire.

It decided to transition away from Communism not directly to capitalism but a system that would suit them - very, very slowly so that they would be more in control of the transition itself and what it was transformed into without being raped by this group.\n\n### Can you find an owl / Y there?\n\nTRANSLATION: Can you find either the cultists who use the symbol of the owl, or a Rothschild in China and Russia?\n\nRussia is different than China in that when the USSR was brought down it was mostly subjugated again. Several puppets assisted in that effort until Putin was elected and turned it around. As such, there are those bad actors in the network who use the owl as their symbol, and it is a delicate balancing act for Putin: keep the country free and somewhat open but protect the country from these people. The Rothschild family is banned in Russia and it also has a standing arrest warrant for George Soros.\n\nChina has two factions always fighting for control through it's entire history (simplistic explanation). One faction will work with those who use the owl as their symbol against the other faction who is adamantly against all that it represents and does.\n\n### Was this to prevent evil from entering?\n\nPossibly to prevent outside influence post WW2\n\nThe three families (Saud, Rothschild and later Soros) have had enormous influence after WW2, all negative. Their programs and policies erode culture, promote degeneracy, financially enslave and destroy nations. All three families happen to be Jewish.\n\n### Was this to protect their children/people?\n\nYes\n\nReference Magnisky act. Two weeks after Obama signed the Magnitsky Act, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill that blocked adoption of Russian children by parents in the United States. Russia then also imposed sanctions on Browder and found Magnitsky posthumously guilty of crimes.  Some say this was done by Putin to stop the flow of Russian children being adopted for trafficking.\n\n### Why was BO shamed during trip to China, SA, other locations?\n\nObama was a puppet/messenger only. There is no reason to give the highest regards to a puppet/illegitimate President.\n- Obama was snubbed for trying to meddle in Chinese internal affairs. Need to look more specific.\n- Involvement in cults/pedophilia\n- Representative of the cabal of families and their network of bad actors\n\nObama was on his way out as president in 2016. He was humiliated by China, the Philipines, and Russia. Other than the climate deal, there was increasing amounts of friction between the countries. It was said that the US was looking weak and tired. They saw an opportunity to make Obama look weak. White House statement, Obama told Xi of \"America's unwavering support for upholding human rights.\" Xi told Obama in response, \"China opposes any other country interfering in its internal affairs in the name of human rights issues.\"\n\n### How was POTUS hosted?\n\nLike the new Leader of the World.\nTrump was treated with the highest level of respect possible; usually associated with royalty/ deeply honored guests.  POTUS was the first world leader to be invited to dinner at the Forbidden City (China) by Xi.  He also was given a private tour by the premier and his wife of all the major places revered in China, with historically unique honors\n\nSword dance in SA; traditionally a pre-battle ritual for warriors on the same side.\n\n### Compare.\n\nOne projected weakness not only of himself (puppet) but also his masters (puppeteers).
